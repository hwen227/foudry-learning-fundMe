# FundMe Smart Contract Project

This is my first project using the [Foundry framework](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), where I followed the [Cyfrin Full Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu) to develop a **FundMe** smart contract. This project covers a simple but complete development workflow in Foundry, including:

- **Smart Contract Development**: Writing the FundMe contract in Solidity.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Deploying the contract to a blockchain using Foundry's scripting capabilities.
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests and integration tests to ensure contract functionality.

## Project Overview

The **FundMe** contract allows users to contribute ETH and keeps track of the funding process. While the contract itself is simple, it gave me hands-on experience in using Foundry for the entire development lifecycle.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hwen227/foudry-learning-fundMe.git

cd foundry-learning-fundMe

code .
```


## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand the key components of the Foundry framework, including:

- Writing and deploying smart contracts.
- Creating test scripts for both unit and integration tests.
- Deploying contracts to various blockchain networks.




## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
